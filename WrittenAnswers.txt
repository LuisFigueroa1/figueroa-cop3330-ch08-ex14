-   A non-reference function argumernt const can be
    declared as for example int f(const int);

-   It means that we are declaring the function argument 
    as constant which specifies a variable's value as 
    constant which prevents the programmer to modifying it
    throught the code.

-   We might want to do this if we want to document the program 
    clearly and enforce the documentation, so for example if a user 
    wants to do performance optimizations, tehy can do it without,
    the fear of damaging the data reference because const won't allow
    the data to be changed as it will produce a compiler error.

-   Some people might want to avoid doing this though, the reason is 
    that there can be too much "const" use can cause some problems in the 
    code for example if is a code that needs to be dynamic and change the 
    data referenced, if is using "const" it will produce a compiler error
    and the data wont be changed, but if the "const" is omitted then the 
    data can be changed whic in some codes is needed, because sometimes
    is a disadvantage for the data to stay without changing throught the 
    whole program.
